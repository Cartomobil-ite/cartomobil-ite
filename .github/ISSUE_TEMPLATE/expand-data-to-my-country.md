Thanks for your interest ! We hope you are safe during this lockdown. 

We are working hard to be able to expand operations outside of France. But first, a little disclaimer.
The first days of "Ça reste ouvert" the app created **thousands of notes** via the contribute form. We have since worked to make automatic edits, but some notes are still created. You need to keep up with theses.
 
Except this, you can expect thousands of contributions quickly and improve the coverage of shops in your country in OSM, so this is pretty cool!

Please check the following requirements:

- [ ] You are a team of at least 2 people experienced with OpenStreetMap
- [ ] Translate the app via transifex with your country languages
- [ ] Translate some content of the blog to help newcomers (how to create a new shop, the about page, ...)
- [ ] Start gathering data about shop open or closed nation wide in https://github.com/PanierAvide/Covid_enseignes/
- [ ] Once everything has been done and the data have been loaded, you should be busy getting media coverage. So the map will have a lot of contribution and be quickly useful.

Others questions:

- if you want a localized domain name, please tell us which one: 
- Each lockdown is different, what shops are open or closed in your country? What should be done in the category list?
