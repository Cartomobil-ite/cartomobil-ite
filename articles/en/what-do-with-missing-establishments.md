'It remains open' is based on OpenStreetMap(OSM) data. It's something like a “Wikipedia of cartography”: a map of the whole world that you can enrich based on your local knowledge of your neighborhood.

And that's what we're going to do: improve the map to add this missing business!

### First step: create an account

Before starting, you need to create an account on the official OpenStreetMap site.

Register on [OpenStreetMap.org](https://osm.org/user/new)

This step is essential to join the community, modify the map and interact with other local contributors.

### Second step: modify the area
You can then navigate to OpenStreetMap.org in the same way while it stays open or to explore other areas in your neighborhood.

Zoom into where you want to add an establishment, then click the **Edit** button at the top left.

On your first time to use OpenStreetMap, a short guide will explain the main things you need to know how to contribute. We recommend that you follow it to the end to familiarize yourself with the contribution, but we will only need the Points section to add our missing establishment.

### Third step: Create the business

To create a missing place, click on the click on the “Point”, button move the pointer to the correct position, and click the mouse button.

Then, using the search field on the left of your screen, fill-in the type of business you want to create. For example, a "pharmacy."

> If you want to add a franchised business or business chain , you can also search for the brand name (for example “Mercury Drug” or “TGP”)

### Fourth step: add useful information

Fill in information about this business, such as its name or phone number.

You don't have to fill out the entire form: if you can't remember the restaurant name, it's alright.

###  Step five: save your changes

When you are done, all you have to do is save the changes by clicking on the button at the top right of the screen.

Add a short comment to indicate what you have changed on the map, then click on the “Send” button.

### That's it!

Congratulations on this first contribution, and welcome to the OpenStreetMap community!

All you have to do is wait: new shops are added regularly and automatically in 'It remains open' . You can then indicate any additional information useful in confinement time, directly on the site.


##### Some additional remarks

Before creating your missing business, carefully examine the existing places: it may already be there, but with the wrong type!

OpenStreetMap is a public map: do not enter any personal data concerning yourself or the merchants you add.

Do not copy information from other maps, they are generally protected by copyright.

##### I need help

If you encounter difficulties or have questions, do not hesitate to check out the [Beginners' Guide](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide) in the OpenStreetMap wiki - or the [LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/) modules!

We are counting on you and your knowledge of your neighborhood to create the best map in the world and act together in concrete terms during this Covid-19 situation.
